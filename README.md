Go-Ubiquitous-Sunshine-Watch-Face
===================================

Android Wear: A custom watch face for Android Wear that uses the Sunshine weather app to display the weather along with the time.

This watch face uses the `Wearable.MessageApi` to send and receive messages to and from the `WearableListenerService`. The `WearableListenerService` then queues the `ContentProvider` for today's forecast and sends it as a msg to the wearable. The forecast is finally drawn on the watch face along with the time!

The app synchronizes weather information from OpenWeatherMap on Android Phones and Tablets. Used in the Udacity Advanced Android course.
